## Objectives

This week I will explore more on two topics: PBS(proposer-builder separation) 
and Portal network, which are pivotal to understanding the concepts of "the Splurge" and "the Purge", respectively.

I need to:
- **develop two comprehensive research documents**
    - For each topic(PBS and Portal network), I will prepare a detailed research document to cover the following aspects:
        - why it should be done
        - how it can be done
        - current progress and future work

- **select one as EPF project based on research**
    - Based on the insight gained from the research documents, I will make an decision on which topic to pursue. The selection will include factors such as potential impact, feasibility, and personal interest



## Output
### PBS
My notes: [PBS Overview](/notes//steven_notes/PBS.md) 

### Portal Network
[The Portal Network](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/portal-network/). This resource from the official Ethereum website provides an excellent explanation of the Portal Network, addressing pertinent queries and serving as a valuable reference point.

## Decision and Next Steps
Both the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) and the Portal Network hold substantial importance for the future of Ethereum, sparking a keen interest in contributing to their development. However, upon careful consideration, I have decided to focus on the Portal Network for the following reasons:
- **Stage of Development**: ePBS remains in the research phase, representing a vast undertaking that could extend over one to two years. Although I plan to monitor its progress closely, the current stage presents challenges for immediate involvement
- **Opportunity for Contribution**: The Portal Network already boasts a detailed specification and is supported by three client implementations, yet it lacks a Go-based client. This gap presents a unique opportunity for me to contribute by developing a Go client, leveraging my skills and interests.

Starting next week, my endeavors will be directed towards gaining a deeper understanding of the Portal Network. Concurrently, I will continue to enhance my knowledge of Geth and related technologies, balancing my commitment to contributing meaningfully while expanding my expertise.
