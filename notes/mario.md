# Hangout call #1

On Thursday, March 7 we are having our first EPFsg hangout. Looking forward to finally speak to folks from the group. 

Use this folder to create your own notes during the call, collect resources and share them with others. 

The call is informal but will be divided to main parts:

- Breakout rooms
- Wiki work in progress
- Free chat
