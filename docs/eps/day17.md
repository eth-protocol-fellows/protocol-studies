# Study Group Lecture 17 | EVM

The introductory part of the study group is now over and we are now starting the deeper dive with live sessions from core developers.

The second session of this week is diving into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with a lecture by [<name>Paweł</name> Bylica](https://github.com/chfast) from Ipsilon team.

Watch the lecture recording on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYnx_YQS8cM). [Slides](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/protocol-studies/blob/main/docs/eps/presentations/day17_evm.pdf).

## Pre-reading

Before starting with the Day 17 content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially day 3 on EL and day 12 on EL client. You should have general understanding of what is EVM and different parts of execution layer.
Some familiarity with virtual machines, assemblers or interpreters may be handy, but is not required.

Additionally, you can get ready by browsing the following concepts related to Ethereum execution:

- [Transactions](https://ethereum.org/yo/developers/docs/transactions/)
- [Accounts](https://ethereum.org/yo/developers/docs/accounts/)
- [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/yo/developers/docs/evm/)
- [Interactive EVM opcodes](https://www.evm.codes)

## Outline

- Ethereum State Transition
