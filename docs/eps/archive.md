The study group was originally run as a 10-week study program with 16 sessions in total. The original sessions are divided into 3 areas, each covering one part of the Ethereum protocol curriculum. 

Watch each lecture sequentially, study supplied materials and exercises. We recommend making notes and in case of any extra information, explanation needed, come to ask to Office Hours or a discord channel. 

## Schedule

Each session is created by a core developer or researcher, comes with reading materials to get you familiar with the topic context and some also include exercises to strengthen and practice your understanding. More resources on each topic can be found in the wiki section and if they are any missing, contribute to add them. 

During first 2 weeks, participants watch previous videos and study existing materials for the given day in their own time. Every day at _3PM UTC we will hold a daily office hours running for 2 hours_ where everyone can discuss their learnings, ask questions, exchange knowledge, etc. Join at the [Office Hours call link](https://meet.ethereum.org/eps-office-hours).

#### Protocol introduction

The first part of the Study Group is an introduction to the protocol, overview of its parts and development process.

### Streams and recordings

Talks and calls are announced week in advance based on the schedule above. Recordings of all talks can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@ethprotocolfellows) or [StreamEth](https://streameth.org/archive?organization=ethereum_protocol_fellowship) archive. 

Apart from weekly lectures, there are less regular, ad-hoc hangout calls for informal chats and calls for wiki contributors working the content. Join the Discord group to get notified about all of these events.
