# Ethereum Protocol Studies

[Ethereum Protocol Studies group (EPS)](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/02/05/ethereum-protocol-studies) is a community formed to gather knowledge, learn, and educate the public about the Ethereum protocol. 

The protocol evolves and grows quickly, it's an always-changing infinite garden. To sustain its credible neutrality, this pace should be reflected in growing and educating the core community. Everyone using, building or living on Ethereum should be able to learn and become involved in the core protocol. The complexity of the architecture, codebases and dynamic development paired with scattered resources can discourage many talented people from participating.

Originally started in 2024, the study group is a participatory educational program that aims to improve core protocol education by introducing a curriculum focused on all parts of the Ethereum stack, building a wiki knowledge base and creating a community focused on learning about the protocol.

> The Study Group is active for 2 months a year, meeting live and creating new content. But meanwhile, you can use all existing content for your own studies and join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8RPnPGEQtJ) to chat about it

## Program Structure

The study group content is structured into 4 tracks. Introduction with high level overview of the protocol, development process and research. Then it dives deeper into each part of the protocol in consensus, execution and research. 

### Study Group content

Each session is created by a core developer or researcher, comes with reading materials to get you familiar with the topic context and some also include exercises to strengthen and practice your understanding. More resources on each topic can be found in the wiki section and if they are any missing, contribute to add them.

#### Protocol introduction

The first part of the Study Group is an introduction to the protocol, overview of its parts and development process.

### Streams and recordings

Talks and calls are announced week in advance based on the schedule above. Recordings of all talks can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@ethprotocolfellows) or [StreamEth](https://streameth.org/archive?organization=ethereum_protocol_fellowship) archive. 

Apart from weekly lectures, there are less regular, ad-hoc hangout calls for informal chats and calls for wiki contributors working the content. Join the Discord group to get notified about all of these events.

## Participate

The study group is an open and permissionless, and it is up to each participant as to how they want to approach it. Whether you want to learn as much as possible, focus only on certain topics or share your knowledge with others, you are welcomed. 

> Join our community in [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8RPnPGEQtJ). We use it for the easiest community engagement but we are aware that Discord is proprietary and doesn't respect user privacy. Consider using alternative FOSS clients like [Dissent](https://github.com/diamondburned/dissent) or [WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord). For enhancing the regular client, check [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord/) project.

Study group participants collaboratively develop the [Protocol wiki](/docs/wiki/wiki-intro.md), serving as an evolving knowledge base for current and future core developers. This can provide students with practical experience in contributing to open source resources, while gaining invaluable experience in documentation and community-driven development.

While this program is designed to act as a precursor to the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship, the study group is for anyone that is interested in learning more about the inner workings of the Ethereum Protocol. Those that have some general knowledge or use of Ethereum and/or blockchains as well as those that have some computer science, technical, or developer experience will get the most from this program.

## Calls troubleshooting

For our weekly meetings, we are using a self-hosted FOSS platform Jitsi. Even though we are doing our best, some people might experience problems during these calls, here are a few tips on troubleshooting:

- Restart your browser and rejoin
- Try a different browser (especially if you are using a Chromium based, try Firefox and vice versa)
- Use the [mobile Jitsi app](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) instead of desktop (you just need to point it to our domain meet.ethereum.org)
- Check your network and firewall settings, make sure your browser allows WebRTC
- Visit Jitsi [community forum](https://community.jitsi.org/) to search for specific issue or report your problem

## FAQ

- **Will I learn to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain?**
    - No. This program is not focused on Solidity or development of decentralized applications. 
- **When does it start and is the duration?**
    - The program runs from February 17 and continues for 8 weeks, concluding in April.
- **Am I automatically accepted to EPF after attending EPFsg**
    - No. The study group is a great way to prepare for EPF, but it doesn't guarantee anything. However, EPF is a permissionless program, so you can always participate. 
- **Where is the study group located?**
    - As all core Ethereum teams, EPFsg is distributed around the globe. We will do our best to accommodate call times for the program participants.
- **Do I need to apply and be accepted?**
    - The program is fully open, anyone can participate. We only ask you to submit a [form](https://forms.gle/G5V95qyGV8uMjKGcA) survey to let us know about your preferences, but it doesn't have any effect on your participation.
