# EPF Protocol Studies

Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Study Group (EPFsg) is a community formed gathering knowledge, learning and educating about the Ethereum protocol. 

The protocol evolves and grows quickly, it's an always-changing infinite garden. To sustain its credible neutrality, this pace should be reflected in the community as well. Various communities using, building or living on Ethereum need to be able to learn and become involved in the core protocol. The complexity of the architecture, codebases and dynamic development with scattered resources can discourage many talented people from participating on the core level. The protocol study group aims to bridge the gap by introducing a curriculum focused on all parts of the Ethereum stack, building a wiki and gathering people interested in diving into it. 

> The study group was originally running from February to April 2024 as an open open, 10-week study program. Although these regular presentations are over, all of the content produced is available here and the community is still active. 

## Program Structure

The study group content is structured in 2 stages of weekly presentations. To follow the study group, you can watch presentations and read related resources week by week. 

The first half is dedicated to general understanding of the internal mechanisms of the protocol, its architecture and basic concepts. The second half offers 2 different tracks - development and research. Presentations in each track offer a deeper dive into specific topics within the R&D domains.  

Each session is led by core developer or researcher, comes with reading materials to get you familiar with the topic context and some also include exercises to strengthen  and practice your understanding.

Weekly sessions, their presentations and materials can be all found in this section under Presentations. 

### Presentations 

The first part of the program consists of 6 sessions with introductions to high level domains of the protocol. 

> Because some speakers did more technical talks than others, the recommended order for newcomers to start is Week 1, Week 3, Week 2, Week 5 Node workshop and then Week 4 and 5.

### Streams and recordings

Talks and calls are announced week in advance based on the schedule above. Recordings of all talks can be found on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@ethprotocolfellows) or [StreamEth](https://streameth.org/archive?organization=ethereum_protocol_fellowship) archive. 

Apart from weekly lectures, there are less regular, ad-hoc hangout calls for informal chats and calls for wiki contributors working the content. Join the Discord group to get notified about all of these events.

## Participate

The study group is an open and permissionless, and it is up to each participant as to how they want to approach it. Whether you want to learn as much as possible, focus only on certain topics or share your knowledge with others, you are welcomed. 

> Join our community in [Discord server](https://discord.gg/addwpQbhpq). We use it for the easiest community engagement but we are aware that Discord is proprietary and doesn't respect user privacy. Consider using alternative FOSS clients like [Dissent](https://github.com/diamondburned/dissent) or [Discordo](https://github.com/ayn2op/discordo).

Study group participants collaboratively develop the [Protocol wiki](/wiki/wiki-intro.md), serving as an evolving knowledge base for current and future core developers. This can provide students with practical experience in contributing to open source resources, while gaining invaluable experience in documentation and community-driven development.

While this program is designed to act as a precursor to the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship, the study group is for anyone that is interested in learning more about the inner workings of the Ethereum Protocol. Those that have some general knowledge or use of Ethereum and/or blockchains as well as those that have some computer science, technical, or developer experience will get the most from this program.

## Calls troubleshooting

For our weekly meetings, we are using a self-hosted FOSS platform Jitsi. Even though we are doing our best, some people might experience problems during these calls, here are few tips on troubleshooting:

- Restart your browser and rejoin
- Try a different browser (especially if you are using a Chromium based, try Firefox and vice versa)
- Use the [mobile Jitsi app](https://jitsi.org/downloads/) instead of desktop (you just need to point it to our domain)
- Check your network and firewall settings, make sure your browser allows WebRTC
- Visit Jitsi [community forum](https://community.jitsi.org/) to search for specific issue or report your problem

## FAQ

- **Will I learn to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain?**
    - No. This program is not focused on Solidity or development of decentralized applications. 
- **When does it start and is the duration?**
    - The program ran from February 2024 and continued for 10 weeks, concluding by the end of April.
- **Am I automatically accepted to EPF after attending EPFsg**
    - No. The study group is a great way to prepare for EPF, but it doesn't guarantee anything. However, EPF is a permissionless program, so you can always participate. 
- **Where is the study group located?**
    - As all core Ethereum teams, EPFsg is distributed around the globe. We will do our best to accommodate call times for the program participants.
- **Do I need to apply and be accepted?**
    - The program is fully open, anyone can participate. We only ask you to submit a [form](https://forms.gle/7TqmryC217EPwgqr9) to let us know about your preferences, but it doesn't have any effect on your participation.
