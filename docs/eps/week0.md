    - Public key cryptography
- Data structures
    - Merkle trees
- Networking, p2p and distributed systems
- Software development basics
    - Programming langauges, compilers
- Ethereum as a platform

    - As a dapp developer

These are just general suggestions of domain knowledge you will need. More detailed learning resources will be provided during the program.
