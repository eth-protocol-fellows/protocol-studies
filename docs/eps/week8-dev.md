# Study Group Week 8 | Consensus client architecture

The Week 8 development track provides a look into Ethereum consensus layer client codebase, explaining its architecture and functions. 

Join the presentation by [Paul Harris](https://twitter.com/rolfyone) from Consensys Teku on [Wednesday, April 8, 7PM UTC](https://savvytime.com/converter/utc-to-germany-berlin-united-kingdom-london-china-shanghai-ny-new-york-city-japan-tokyo-australia-sydney-india-delhi-argentina-buenos-aires/apr-1-2024/3pm). (Note that this is 3 hours later than the default time)

The talk will be streamed live on [StreamEth](https://streameth.org/65cf97e702e803dbd57d823f/epf_study_group) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@ethprotocolfellows/streams), links will be provided before the call in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/addwpQbhpq). Discord also serves for the discussion and questions during the stream. 

## Pre-reading

Before starting with the week 8 development content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially week 3 resources on consensus layer. 

Paul will dive into Teku, consensus client implementation in Java. You should have at least basic knowledge of the language syntax. 

[Consensus-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/) is executable, and a passing knowledge of python may be beneficial, but it's a fairly easy language to reason about at the level the specs are written.

Additionally, you can get ready by studying the following resources:

- [Post-Merge Ethereum Client Architecture by Adrian Sutton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d4pkhL37Ao)
- [Teku Architecture, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PHZHpVPLk4)
- [Teku docs](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/)

## Outline

- Teku CL client
- Brief introduction into our rest api's, declarative framework
- A look at development process EIP -> spec -> code
    - Examples of EIP-7251 (maxEB)
