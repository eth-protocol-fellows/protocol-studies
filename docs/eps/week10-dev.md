## Pre-reading

Before starting with the week 10 development content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially week 2 and week 8. You should have understanding of the execution client architecture and EVM. 

The talk will use examples from Besu, a Java implementation of execution client. At least basic understanding of Java syntax is recommended.

Additionally, you can get ready by studying the following resources:
- [Exploring Precompiled Contracts on Ethereum: A Deep Dive](https://lucasmartincalderon.medium.com/exploring-precompiled-contracts-on-ethereum-a-deep-dive-4e9f9682e0aa)
- [Precompiles documentation by evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes/precompiled)

## Outline

- EVM Precompiles
- How they are integrated
- Which precompiles exist 
- How L2s and L1s use them
- Challanges of creating precompiles
