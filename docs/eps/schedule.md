# Study Group Schedule

The study group was originally run as a 10-week study program with 16 sessions in total. The original sessions are divided into 3 areas, each covering one part of the Ethereum protocol curriculum. 

Watch each lecture sequentially, study supplied materials and exercises. We recommend making notes and in case of any extra information, explanation needed, come to ask to Office Hours or a discord channel. 

## Schedule

Each session is created by a core developer or researcher, comes with reading materials to get you familiar with the topic context and some also include exercises to strengthen and practice your understanding. More resources on each topic can be found in the wiki section and if they are any missing, contribute to add them. 

During first 2 weeks, participants watch previous videos and study existing materials for the given day in their own time. Every day at _3PM UTC we will hold a daily office hours running for 2 hours_ where everyone can discuss their learnings, ask questions, exchange knowledge, etc. Join at the [Office Hours call link](https://meet.ethereum.org/eps-office-hours).

> We recommend watching videos from the study group using faster playback speed, 1.25 or 1.5x to save some time

#### Week 1

The first week will cover the first five weeks of previous Study Group content. The first day provides an introduction to the Study Group and the protocol itself. Then, we will dive into each part of the protocol. On Wednesday, the node workshop will also be held live during office hours.

#### Week 2

The second week of the study group provides an overview of developer experience in Ethereum protocol. It covers the development track of the previous study group and provides an insight into various parts of the development process - from specification, CL/EL client architecture to hands on devops and testing.
