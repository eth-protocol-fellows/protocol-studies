# Study Group Week 7 | Verkle Trees

Week 7 research talk is focused on verkle trees, an important domain of current research and development aiming to replace the MPT and enable statelessness.

Watch the talk by [Guillaume](https://twitter.com/gballet/), [Ignacio](https://twitter.com/ignaciohagopian) and [Josh](https://twitter.com/rudolf6_) on StreamEth or Youtube. Slides are [available here](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/protocol-studies/blob/main/docs/eps/presentations/week7-research.pdf).

## Pre-reading

Before starting with the week 7 development content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially week 2 and other content focused on execution layer. You should have at least understanding of merkle trees and current data structures in Ethereum.

Additionally, you can read and get ready by studying the following resources:

- [Data structures in Ethereum](/wiki/EL/data-structures.md)
- [Guillaume Ballet - The Verge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Ne19Vew6w)

## Outline

- The Verge, motivation and benefits
- Verkle cryptography
- Data structures
- Gas pricing 
- Transitioning the state tree to verkle 
- Current state and challenges 
- Questions from audience
