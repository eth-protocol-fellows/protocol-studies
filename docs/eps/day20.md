## Pre-reading

Before starting with the Day 20 content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially day 2 on CL, day 6 on specs (at least the CL part) and day 16 on the consensus mechanism.

Additionally, you can get ready by studying the following resources.

- [Annotated spec on validator incentives](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/)
