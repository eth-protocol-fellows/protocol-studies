# Study Group Lecture 16 | Consensus and Gasper

The introductory part of the study group is now over and we are now starting the deeper dive with live sessions from core developers. 

For the first session of this week, we are diving into the consensus mechanism of Ethereum with Ben Edgington. Ben is a seasoned core contributor who worked on Teku consensus client, Optimism and is author of Eth2 Book, the annotated specification. 

> Join the live talk by Ben on [Monday, 10.3. at 3PM UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20250310T150000&p1=1440&p2=37&p3=136&p4=237&p5=923&p6=204&p7=671&p8=16&p9=41&p10=107&p11=28) to watch the lecture and ask questions directly.

## Pre-reading

Before starting with the Day 16 content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially day 2 on CL and day 6 on specs (at least the CL part). You should have general understanding of Beacon Chain and different mechanism in Ethereum consensus layer. 

Additionally, you can get ready by studying the following resources.

- Vitalik's [Beacon Chain Fork Choice](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/fork-choice.md) - outdated, but still excellent
- [Consensus chapter](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/consensus/) in the Upgrading Ethereum book
- [Annotated spec on fork choice](https://eth2book.info/latest/part3/forkchoice/phase0/) 

## Outline

- Introduction to Fork Choice
- LMD GHOST
- Casper FFG
- Gasper
- Q&A

## Additional reading and exercises

- Original Casper FFG paper: [Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437)
- Gasper: [Combining GHOST and Casper (Gasper paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052)
- [The blue eyes puzzle](https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html) - think hard! Don't give in and look up the solution too soon.
