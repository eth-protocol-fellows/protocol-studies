# Study Group Week 3 | Consensus Layer

The third week of EPFsg dives into the Consensus layer of Ethereum. 

Watch the presentation on overview of the CL with Alex Stokes on [StreamEth](https://streameth.org/watch?event=&session=65e9f54579935301489a01eb) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqKjWYt6yWk). Presentations slides are [available here](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/protocol-studies/tree/main/docs/eps/presentations/week3_presentation.pdf).

## Pre-reading

Before starting with the week 3 content, make yourself familiar with resources in [week 2](/eps/week2.md). 

Additionally, you can read and get ready by studying the following resources:
- [Ethereum.org docs on Proof-of-stake](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos) and its subtopics
- [Beacon Chain explainer](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain)
- [PoS and Solar Punk Future, Dany Ryan 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N10a1EBhBc), a talk before the Merge, great insight into the Merge and Beacon Chain development and testing

## Outline

- Blockchain enables creating a digital scarcity but it needs security which ensures its integrity
- Distributed networks deal with Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)
- Bitcoin first solved the BFT with PoW
- Ethereum moves to proof-of-stake, switching from exogenous signal for Sybil protection to endogenous in the system
- Uses BFT majority to determine the state of the chain 
    - Byzantine faults can be observed by the protocol and stake can be `slashed`
    - The fork choice rule summarized in LMD-GHOST
    - It ensures liveness thanks to Casper
- Provides more cryptoeconomic security

After learning about both EL and CL, run a client pair. Spin a pair of one execution and consensus client, read their logs to learn how they operate.
