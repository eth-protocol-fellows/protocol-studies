# Ethereum Protocol Fellowship 

EPF is a program for everyone interested in starting to contribute to Ethereum core protocol. Organized by EF Protocol Support, the program is divided into yearly cohorts, each running for 4-5 months. The program was originally started as CDAP by Piper Merriam and grew with each cohort.

Because the protocol, its development and research is fully public and open, anyone can start contributing. But the understanding of current issues, identifying a project to work on and connecting with other contributors can pose a barrier to start, EPF helps to smooth this process. 

The fellowship is fully open and permissionless, anyone can join the community to start working their area of interest. The cohort opens up with an application process and ends with EPF Day in-person event at Devcon.  The most active and skilled contributors might be eligible for stipend at the start of the cohort based on their application or retrospectively. 

> Upcoming EPF cohorts are announced when applications open. Follow the [mailing list, EPS discord and EF blog](/eps/intro.md#important-links) to stay informed. 

All work done within EPF cohorts can be found in [eth-protocol-fellows repositories](https://github.com/orgs/eth-protocol-fellows/repositories). Each cohort repo includes `/projects` directory with all project proposals and `dev-updates.md` document tracking weekly progress of every participant. Use these resources to learn about the protocol, fellows' work and get inspiration for your own projects.
