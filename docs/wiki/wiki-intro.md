# Welcome to Protocol Wiki

Protocol Wiki is a learning resource for anyone diving into Ethereum protocol, its development and research. It has been created during EPF Study Group as collaborative effort to create a contextual documentation of important domains of the protocol. 

## Using the wiki 

The wiki structure follows the design of Ethereum protocol. It's divided into sections mapping to important areas of the protocol and its development. Each section consists of pages covering its most relevant parts and provides a technical overview. Sections and its topics can be navigated in the left sidebar. 

> Wiki pages provide a context and explanation but also serve as a collection of external resources covering the topic. Use the resource section at the bottom of each page to learn more about the topic. 

To learn about a specific topic, identify what section it belongs to or use the search bar to find occurrences of the relevant term. If there is an important topic currently missing, open an [issue](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/protocol-studies/issues) to let other know. For contributing yourself, check [contribution guidelines](/contributing.md) first. 

The wiki is written by a community of volunteers and continues to grow. Many pages are marked as _stubs_ and don't yet fully cover the topic.
