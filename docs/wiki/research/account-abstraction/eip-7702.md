[EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)  is a proposal aimed at enhancing Ethereum's account abstraction capabilities. Account abstraction allows for more flexible and programmable account management, enabling features such as multi-signature wallets, social recovery, and gasless transactions. This proposal seeks to improve the user experience and security by decoupling the logic of transaction validation from the underlying account model.

The primary goal of EIP-7702 is to introduce a standardized framework that allows developers to create custom transaction validation logic. A new transaction type (Type 4) is introduced to secure and allow user-friendly wallet solutions, as well as innovative use cases that were previously not possible with the traditional account model. By abstracting the account logic, EIP-7702 aims to reduce the complexity of smart contract interactions and lower the barrier to entry for new users.

With this feature, users can set their address to be represented by a code of an existing smart contract. Type 4 transaction allows address owners to sign an authorization that sets their address to mimic a chosen smart contract.
With this EIP, users can opt in to programmable wallets that allow new features like transaction bundling, gasless transacting and custom asset access for alternative recovery schemes. It's another step towards [account abstraction](https://ethereum.org/roadmap/account-abstraction/) that improves user experience and security when interacting with Ethereum.
