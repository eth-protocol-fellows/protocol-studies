# ETHERUM PROTOCOL ROADMAP
---
## The Infinite Garden
***Abstract***

*Ethereum is NOT a zero sum game, but rather a game that we want to play continuously. For that to be a reality, the Infinite Garden needs to upgrade regulary, on topics like its security, scalability or sustainability, untill it will reach ossification. After that point there will probably be, just some trims - here and there.*

**Where are we now?**

At the moment, according to community consent, we are at about 55% into the roadmap. 

**How does Ethereum evolve?**

The roadmap is mostly the result of years of work by researchers and developers, [according to the Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/#why-does-ethereum-need-a-roadmap)

New ideeas emerge constantly from within the protocol's permissionless [research and development](#resources) communities/groups. 
When new ideas mature, they grow up to be Ethereum Improvement Proposals [(EIPs)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#ethereum-improvement-proposals-eips).

The EIPs that are related to core Ethereum protocol are named [core EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/core)

**Who participates?**

* motivated, Ethereum passionate community members
* entities/organizations working in the application layer
* end-users that want to help mitigating frictions like transaction speeds and cost, etc 

## Main Roadmap 'urges' 
**Grouped by expected effects on protocol architecture**:

**the Merge** - upgrades relating to the switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. [[zoom diagram]](/docs/images/roadmap_2024/the_Merge_SSF.png)

**the Surge** - upgrades related to scalability by rollups and data sharding [[zoom diagram]](/docs/images/roadmap_2024/the_Surge.jpeg)

**the Scourge** - upgrades related to censorship resistance, decentralization and protocol risks from MEV [[zoom diagram]](/docs/images/roadmap_2024/the_Scourge.jpeg)

**the Verge** - upgrades related to verifying blocks more easily [[zoom diagram]](/docs/images/roadmap_2024/the_Verge.jpeg)

**the Purge** - upgrades related to reducing the computational costs of running nodes and simplifying the protocol [[zoom diagram]](/docs/images/roadmap_2024/the_Purge.png)

**the Splurge** - other upgrades that don't fit well into the previous categories [[zoom diagram]](/docs/images/roadmap_2024/the_Splurge.png)

## State of the art

| Upgrade | Part of | Description | Expected effect | State of the art |
| :-----| :-----: | :----: | :-------: | :------- |
| Sigle slot finality (SSF)| the Merge | Blocks could get proposed and finalized in the same slot | More convenient for apps and much more difficult to attack| in research |
| Proto-danksharding | the Surge | We can move the data into a temporary 'blob' storage that gets deleted from Ethereum once is no longer needed. | Reduced transaction costs | [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) |

## Timeline

It's hard to predict the timing of all the protocol level upgrades, because they happen often in paralel, and at different speeds. Some roadmap tracks get urgented others delayed, based on  the protocol's need to adapt to external factors and threaths, much like a biological organism/structure responds to stimulus and stress.

Here's Vitalik's view on how the roadmap looks like at December 2023 level and how advanced each "urge" / track is:
