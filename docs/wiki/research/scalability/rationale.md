# Rationale

One more EIP worth mentioning in this section is 4488 which was strongly considered at the time. I still see it mentioned sometimes but it's mostly irrelevant with 4844 done so you can explain it in this context (moving from calldata to blobs). Now the approach is the exact opposite and calldata might become more expensive https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623
