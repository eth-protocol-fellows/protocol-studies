# The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

You have likely observed that Ethereum transactions take some time to finalise, [around 12 seconds](https://web.archive.org/web/20240304145956/https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime) at the time of writing. A series of crucial steps occur during this timeframe. The transaction is first queued in a pool. Then, it is selected by a node and executed by a special program - **the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, the result of which is stored on the blockchain.

This article describes the role of EVM in ethereum ecosystem and how it works. As the EVM executes transactions, it modifies the overall state of ethereum. In that regard, ethereum can be modeled as a **state machine**.

## The Ethereum state machine

In computer science, **state machine** is an abstraction used to model the behavior of a system. It illustrates how a system can be represented by a set of distinct states and how inputs can drive changes in the state.

A familiar example of a state machine is the vending machine, an automated system dispensing products upon receiving payment.

We can model the vending machine existing in three distinct states: idle, awaiting user selection, and dispensing a product. Inputs such as coin insertion or product selection trigger transitions between these states, as depicted in the state diagram:

![Vending machine](../../images/evm/vending-machine.gif)

Let's formally define the components of a state machine:

1. **State ($S$)**: A State represents distinct conditions or configurations that a system can be in at a given point in time.
   For the vending machine, possible states are:

$$ S\in \set {Idle, Selection, Dispensing} $$

2. **Inputs ($I$)**: Inputs are actions, signals, or changes in the system's environment. Input triggers the **state transition function**.
   For the vending machine, possible inputs include:

$$ I\in \set {InsertCoin, SelectDrink, CollectDrink} $$

3. **State transition function ($\Upsilon$)**: State transition function defines how the system transitions from one state to another (or back to the same state) based on an input and its current state. Essentially, it determines how the system evolves in response to inputs.

$$\Upsilon (S,I) \Longrightarrow S'  $$

> Where S' = next state, S= current state and, I= input.

Example state transition for the vending machine:

$$\Upsilon (Idle,InsertCoin) \Longrightarrow Selection $$
$$\Upsilon (Selection,SelectDrink) \Longrightarrow Dispensing $$
$$\Upsilon (Idle,SelectDrink) \Longrightarrow Idle $$

Notice in the last case, the current state transitions back to itself.

### Ethereum as a state machine

Ethereum, as a whole, can be viewed as a **transaction-based state machine**. It receives transactions as inputs and transitions into a new state. The current state of Ethereum is referred to as the **world state**.

Let's consider a simple Ethereum application - an NFT marketplace.

In the current world state **S3** (green), Alice owns an NFT. The animation below shows a transaction transferring ownership to you (**S3** ➡️ **S4**). Similarly, selling the NFT back to Alice would transition the state to **S5**:

![Ethereum state machine](../../images/evm/ethereum-state-machine.gif)

Notice that the world state is animated _as a pulsating green bubble_.

In the model above, each transaction is committed to a new state. However, in reality, a group of transactions is bundled into a **block**, and the resulting state is added to the chain of previous states. It must be apparent now why this technology is called **blockchain**.

Considering the definition of the state transition function, we draw the following conclusion:

> ℹ️ Note  
> **EVM is the state transition function of the Ethereum state machine. It determines how Ethereum transitions into a new (world) state based on input (transactions) and current state.**

## Virtual machine paradigm

Given our grasp of state machines, the next challenge is **implementation**.

Software needs conversion to the target processor's machine language (Instruction Set Architecture, ISA) for execution. This ISA varies across hardware (e.g., Intel vs. Apple silicon). Modern software also relies on the host operating system for memory management and other essentials.

Ensuring functionality within a fragmented ecosystem of diverse hardware and operating systems is a major hurdle. Traditionally, software had to be compiled into native binaries for each specific target platform:

![Platform dependent execution](../../images/evm/platform-dependent-execution.jpg)

To address this challenge, a two-part solution is employed.

First, the implementation targets a **virtual machine**, an abstraction layer. Source code is compiled into **bytecode**, a sequence of bytes representing instructions. Each bytecode maps to a specific operation the virtual machine executes.

The second part involves a platform-specific virtual machine that translates the bytecode into native code for execution.

This offers two key benefits: portability (bytecode runs on different platforms without recompiling) and abstraction (separates hardware complexities from software). Developers can thus write code for a single, virtual machine:

![Virtual machine paradigm](../../images/evm/virtual-machine-paradigm.jpg)

## EVM and the world state

This virtual machine concept serves as an abstraction. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a specific software implementation of this abstraction. The anatomy of the EVM is described below:

![EVM anatomy](../../images/evm/evm-anatomy.jpg)

_For clarity, the figure above simplifies the Ethereum state. The actual state includes additional elements like Message Frames and Transient Storage._

> In Ethereum, the world state is essentially a mapping of 20-byte addresses to account states.

![Ethereum world state](../../images/evm/ethereum-world-state.jpg)

Each account state consists of various components such as storage, code, balance among other data and is associated with a specific address.

Ethereum has two kinds of accounts:

- **External account:** An account [controlled by an associated private key](/wiki/Cryptography/ecdsa.md) and empty EVM code.
- **Contract account:** An account controlled by an associated non-empty EVM code. The EVM code as part of such an account is colloquially known as a _smart contract._

In the anatomy described above, EVM is shown to be manipulating the storage, code, and balance of an account instance.

In a real-world scenario, EVM may execute transactions involving multiple accounts (each with independent storage, code, and balance) enabling complex interactions on Ethereum.

With a better grasp of virtual machines, lets extend our definition:

> ℹ️ Note  
> EVM is the state transition function of the Ethereum state machine. It determines how Ethereum transitions into a new (world) state based on
> input (transactions) and current state. **It is implemented as a virtual machine so that it can run on any platform, independent of the
> underlying hardware.**

## EVM bytecode

EVM bytecode is a representation of a program as a sequence of [**bytes** (8 bits).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) Each byte within the bytecode is either:

- an instruction known as **opcode**, or
- input to an opcode known as **operand**.

![Binary bytecode](../../images/evm/opcode-binary.jpg)

For brevity, EVM bytecode is commonly expressed in [**hexadecimal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) notation:

![Hexadecimal bytecode](../../images/evm/opcode-hex.jpg)

To further enhance comprehension, opcodes have human-readable mnemonics. This simplified bytecode, called **EVM assembly**, is the lowest human-readable form of EVM code:

![EVM Assembly](../../images/evm/opcode-assembly.jpg)

Identifying opcodes from operands is straightforward. Currently, only `PUSH*` opcodes have operands (this might change with [EOF](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7569)). `PUSHX` defines operand length (X bytes after PUSH).

Select Opcodes used in this discussion:

| Opcode | Name     | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 60     | PUSH1    | Push 1 byte on the stack                           |
| 01     | ADD      | Add the top 2 values of the stack                  |
| 02     | MUL      | Multiply the top 2 values of the stack             |

| 52     | MSTORE   | Store word to memory                               |
| 53     | MSTORE8  | Store byte to memory                               |

| 54     | SLOAD    | Load word from storage                             |
| 55     | SSTORE   | Store word to storage                              |
| 56     | JUMP     | Alter the program counter                          |
| 5B     | JUMPDEST | Mark destination for jumps                         |
| f3     | RETURN   | Halt execution returning output data               |

> ℹ️ Note  
> [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/) can propose EVM modifications. For instance, [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153) introduced `TSTORE`, and `TSTORE` opcodes.

We have covered **what** EVM is, let's explore **how** it works.

## Stack

Stack is a simple data structure with two operations: **PUSH** and **POP**. Push adds an item to top of the stack, while pop removes the top-most item. Stack operates on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle - the last element added is the first removed. If you try to pop from an empty stack, a **stack underflow error** occurs.

![EVM stack](../../images/evm/stack.gif)

> The EVM stack has a maximum size of 1024 items.

During bytecode execution, EVM stack functions as a _scratchpad_: opcodes consume data from the top and push results back (See the `ADD` opcode below). Consider a simple addition program:

![EVM stack addition](../../images/evm/stack-addition.gif)

Reminder: All values are in hexadecimal, so `0x06 + 0x07 = 0x0d (decimal: 13)`.

Let's take a moment to celebrate our first EVM assembly code 🎉.

## Program counter

In the example above, the values on the left of the assembly code represent the byte offset (starting at 0) of each opcode within the bytecode:

| Bytecode | Assembly | Length of Instruction in bytes | Offset in hex |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 60 06    | PUSH1 06 | 2                              | 00            |
| 60 07    | PUSH1 07 | 2                              | 02            |
| 01       | ADD      | 1                              | 04            |

EVM **program counter** stores the byte offset of the next opcode (highlighted) to be executed.

![EVM program counter](../../images/evm/program-counter.gif)

The `JUMP` opcode directly sets the program counter, enabling dynamic control flow and contributing to the EVM's [Turing completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) by allowing flexible program execution paths.

![EVM JUMP opcode](../../images/evm/jump-opcode.gif)

The code runs in an infinite loop, repeatedly adding 7. It introduces two new opcodes:

- **JUMP**: Sets the program counter to stack top value (02 in our case), determining the next instruction to execute.
- **JUMPDEST**: Marks the destination of a jump operation, ensuring intended destinations and preventing unwanted control flow disruptions.

## Gas

Our innocent little program may seem harmless. However, infinite loops in EVM pose a significant threat: they can **devour resources**, potentially causing network [**DoS attacks**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)

The EVM's **gas** mechanism tackles such threats by acting as a currency for computational resources. Transactions pay gas in Ether (ETH) to use the EVM, and if they run out of gas before finishing (like an infinite loop), the EVM halts them to prevent resource hogging.

This protects the network from getting clogged by resource-intensive or malicious activities. Since gas restricts computations to a finite number of steps, the EVM is considered **quasi Turing complete**.

![EVM Gas](../../images/evm/evm-gas.gif)

Our example assumed 1 unit of gas per opcode for simplicity, but the actual cost varies based on complexity. The core concept, however, remains unchanged.

Refer [Appendix G of Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) for specific gas costs.
