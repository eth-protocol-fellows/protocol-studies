# The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
You have likely observed that Ethereum transactions take some time to finalise, around 13 seconds at the time of writing. A series of crucial steps occur during this timeframe. The transaction is first queued in a pool. Then, it is selected by a node and executed by a special program - **the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, the result of which is stored on the blockchain.

This article describes the role of EVM in ethereum ecosystem and how it works. As the EVM executes transactions, it modifies the overall state of ethereum. In that respect, ethereum behaves like an abstraction known as **state machine**.
