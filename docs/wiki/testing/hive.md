[Hive](https://github.com/ethereum/hive) is an end-to-end testing harness enabling simulators to [spin up various clients](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/blob/master/docs/clients.md) in a single network with different testing scenarios (simulations). It is a much easier way to test all clients at the same time under the same parameters to make sure none are failing. The tests also have very specific edge cases that can be modified for any possible edge case and simulation/scenario. Due to this simplicity, Hive plays a critical role in testing upcoming forks and network upgrades. 

If you are curious and want to run some of your own tests and simulations, [install Hive](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/blob/master/docs/commandline.md)!

Here are a list of [Hive Simulators](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/tree/master/simulators)

[The Hive Simulator Programming guide](https://github.com/ethereum/hive/blob/master/docs/simulators.md) also explains how to write Hive simulators.
