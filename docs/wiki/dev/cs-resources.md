## Networking

This section covers a brief overview of the differences and similarities between the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) models,
as well as the protocols involved in the transport layer used in DevP2P: TCP and UDP.

In terms of networking, both models refer to the same process of communication between layers.
Just as Kurose and Ross explain (2020), the computer networks are divided into different layers, and each one of them has a specific responsibility. The OSI model has seven layers, while the TCP/IP model has four layers. The OSI model is more theoretical and the TCP/IP model is more practical.
The OSI model is a reference model created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to provide a framework for understanding networks. The TCP/IP model was created by the Department of Defense (DoD) to ensure that messages could be transmitted between computers regardless of the types of computers involved.
The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model:

In summary, the OSI model layers are:
1. Physical layer: responsible for the transmission and reception of raw data between devices.
2. Data link layer: responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message.
3. Network layer: responsible for the delivery of packets from the source to the destination.
4. Transport layer: responsible for the delivery of data between the source and the destination.
5. Session layer: responsible for the establishment, management, and termination of connections between applications.
6. Presentation layer: responsible for the translation, compression, and encryption of data.
7. Application layer: responsible for providing network services directly to the end-user.

Assuming the communication schema proposed by Claude Shannon (1948), every communication implies both a sender and a receiver, a message to be exchanged between them, a transmission medium, and a protocol to be followed.
This is important to mention because regardless of the computer architecture, it could be part of a network if it follows the communication and protocol specifications of the models mentioned above.
