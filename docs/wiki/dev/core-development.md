# Core development

The work on core protocol specification, implmenetation and testing is commonly refered to as core development. Core devs are contributors the client software, its validation and related tooling for building the protocol, all domains covered in this wiki.

There are many implementation of both [consensus](/wiki/CL/cl-clients.md) and [execution](/wiki/EL/el-clients.md) layer developed by various independent teams. Together with teams working on research, testing and other infrastracture, core developers are maintaining the base technology used by everyone building on Ethereum.

[Hsiao-Wei Wang](https://github.com/hwwhww) shared the graphic above in her presentation _[A Journey of an Ethereum Core Dev/Researcher”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lBrd2_fPPU)_ she gave at ETHGlobal Tokyo in April 2023. The graphic symbolizes the connection between a space station and the efforts involved from various teams to bring it to life.

Teams working on separate clients are distributed across diffent organizations, companies or non-profits. They implement the same specification in different languages with various features and performance profiles. The [client diversity](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/client-diversity) is a fundamental principle embraced by Ethereum. The range of different clients can ensure stability and security of the network while keeping the core development decentralized and open to everyone. 

Altough different teams come from different organization, they all work together and collaborate on improving the whole network. Progress is achieved through discussions in public channels, mainly carried out in weekly meetings. These calls are public and tracked in [project management repo](https://github.com/ethereum/pm), including ACD - Execution and Consensus Layer calls, various "Breakout Room" and working group calls. Outside of calls, discussions are held in the Ethereum R&D Discord channel, Eth Magicians forum and EthResearch forum.
