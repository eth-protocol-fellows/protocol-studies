# Cryptography

Cryptography researchers craft the weapons or implements of change that developers use. They use advanced algebra to exploit the hard limits set by the universe on reality and craft cryptographic schemas that obey certain properties. They are in a sense reality-hackers. They hack reality to create systems that obey objective properties due to the underlying mathematics.
