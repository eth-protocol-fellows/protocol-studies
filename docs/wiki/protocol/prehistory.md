# Prehistory of Ethereum

Ethereum's lineage has its roots in early internet's open spirit, with its design philosophy echoing the Unix ideal of 'doing one thing and doing it well'. The rise of the free and open source movement, embodied by Linux, redefined open standards in software. Meanwhile, breakthroughs in public key cryptography and its advocacy by the cypherpunks laid the groundwork for secure, transparent, and decentralized systems like Bitcoin which ultimately inspired Ethereum's vision of building a platform for a borderless, self-sovereign digital economy.

> “If you look at the people that were involved in the early stages of the Bitcoin space, their earlier pedigrees, if they had any pedigrees at all, were in open source—Linux, Mozilla, and cypherpunk mailing lists.”\
> — _Vitalik Buterin, Co-founder of Ethereum_

## The world; now online

From its humble beginnings in 1969 as a Cold War project (ARPANET), the internet has evolved into an unprecedented global phenomenon.

What started as a research tool for a handful of institutions now connects billions worldwide, collapsing geographical borders and facilitating human interactions that were once inconceivable.

> "The Internet's pace of adoption eclipses all other technologies that preceded it. Radio was in existence 38 years before 50 million people tuned in; TV took 13 years to reach that benchmark. Sixteen years after the first PC kit came out, 50 million people were using one. Once it was opened to the general public, the Internet crossed that line in four years."\

## Unix

Unix originated from efforts to simplify the complexities of MULTICS, a large and ambitious operating system project of the 1960s. As MULTICS became unwieldy, a small group including Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs sought to create Unix - a more modular, simpler, and composable alternative:

>"At some point I realized that I was three weeks from an operating system. I'll needed an editor, assembler, and kernel overlay — call it an operating system. One week, one week, one week, and we had Unix."\
> — [_Ken Thompson in an interview_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY6q5dv_B-o)

Unix thus stands as a living testament to how a small group of individuals can profoundly influence the world through software.

Unix introduced concepts like hierarchical file systems, the shell as a command-line interface, single-purpose utilities that could be combined to perform complex tasks:

These foundational principles laid the groundwork for what became known as the UNIX philosophy — favoring simplicity, flexibility, and reusability in software design. Today, UNIX and its derivatives continue to underpin much of modern computing, influencing everything from operating systems like Linux and macOS to the principles of timeless software development.
