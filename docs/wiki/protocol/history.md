## The Merge

On September 15, 2022, Ethereum activated [EIP-3675](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675) and upgraded the consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake through an event known as The Merge. The Merge has resulted in the deprecation of the proof-of-work consensus, which was previously implemented in the same logic layer as execution. Instead, it has been replaced by a more complex and sophisticated proof-of-stake consensus that eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining. New proof-of-stake consensus has been implemented in its own layer with a separate p2p network and logic, also know as Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain has been running and achieving consensus since December 1st, 2020. After a prolonged period of consistent performance without any failures, it was deemed ready to become Ethereum's consensus provider. The Merge gets its name from the union of the two networks.
