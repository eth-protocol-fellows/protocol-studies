# Consensus Layer Implementations

This page covers resources on all consensus client implementations, whether in production or development. It provides an overview of unique features of each client, architecture, basic guides and resources.

> Consensus clients originally used to be called _eth2.0 clients_ which is now a deprecated nomenclature but you can still find this reference in their repositories. 

There are multiple Consensus Layer clients developed to participate in the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. The most popular, FOSS and production ready are [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/),  [Lodestar](https://lodestar.chainsafe.io/), [Nimbus](https://nimbus.team/index.html), [Prysm](https://prysmaticlabs.com/) and [Teku](https://consensys.io/teku). These clients are developed in different programming languages, provide have unique features and offer different performance profiles. All clients support Ethereum mainnet out of the bo as well as currently active testnets. Variety of implementations allows the network to benefit from client diversity. If you are choosing a client to use, current client diversity should be one of the main factors. 

## Clients in production 

## LightHouse

[Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/) is a client developed in the Rust programming language. It is a full-featured Ethereum consensus client that can be used as a beacon node or a validator client. It is developed by [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/). 

### Features

It can also provide a web interface [Siren](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-ui.html) enabling to easily monitor the beacon node and validator performance.

### Installing the client

Lighthouse client can be installed in variety of ways - building from source, running pre-built binaries or using docker. They also provide builds for different architectures like [ARM](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/pi.html) and a guide for [cross-compiling](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/cross-compiling.html). [Validator](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/mainnet-validator.html) client is bundled with the main binary.

#### Using Docker

Lighthouse provides a more illustrative guide to install the client using docker. They have options of [Docker Hub](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/docker.html#docker-hub) and building docker hub [from source](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/docker.html#building-the-docker-image).

#### Building from Source

Just like Prysm, it also has multiple hardware and OS support to built the client from source. The [documentation](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/installation-source.html). Make sure you have correct dependencies installed before building the client.

#### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries for many various operating systems and architectures are available. They also provide portable versions which are compromising compiler performance options for a better platform compatibility. Released binaries are signed by gpg key `15E66D941F697E28F49381F426416DC3F30674B0` from security@sigmaprime.io. Read the [documentation](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/installation-binaries.html) on the steps to install the client using pre-built binaries.

### Additional features and security considerations

Lighthouse client is quite advanced that it proves the following additional features:

- [Slashing Protection](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/faq.html#what-is-slashing-protection)
- [Doppelganger Protection](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator-doppelganger.html#doppelganger-protection)
- [Running a Slasher](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/slasher.html)
- [Builder API for MEV](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/builders.html#maximal-extractable-value-mev)

## Prysm

[Prysm](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/getting-started) is a client developed in the Go programming language. It is one of the most popular clients and has a large community. Using this client, validators can participate in the Ethereum PoS mechanism. Prysm can be used as a beacon node or a validator client. It can assist execution layer clients in processing transactions and blocks. When an execution client is integrated with Prysm, it first syncs the block headers with it since, as a beacon node, it has a full view of the chain. It gossips the latest block headers to the EL client. Then, the EL client can request the block bodies from its p2p network. This is mostly common in the case of all Consensus Layer clients.

Apart from Ethereum mainnet, Prysm can also be run on testnets such as Goerli, Holesky, and Pyrmont. Prysm can be integrated with different EL clients such as [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/), [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/nethermind-client), and [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/), etc. It has a web interface to monitor the beacon chain and validator performance. It also has a RESTful API to interact with the beacon chain and validator client.

### Installing the client

The installation process can be done either using an automated process using docker or a manual process building using the source. Both of these methods have flexibility to run clients on different operating systems, hardware, and roles (beacon node and/or validator client).

#### Using Docker

The easiest and faster way to install the client is [using docker](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-docker). Most of the client related activities in this way comes using the [configuration files](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-docker#configure-ports-optional).

#### Building from Source

One learns slightly more about the client by building it [from source](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-bazel). One also needs to be careful about the hardware specs and [requirements](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-bazel#review-system-requirements) for the client to run smoothly.

### Sample Run

The following is a sample run of the Prysm client on the Ethereum mainnet with Geth Node as an execution client:

#### No Light client support

Currently there is no light client support with Prysm.

### Security considerations and best practices

Consensus client security is somewhat more essential than the Execution Layer client security since Consensus client are not only responsible for the security of the network but also for the security of the validators. Responsibilities such as valid block execution, choosing the correct chain to managing the staking related financials. Prysm has outlined a few [best practices](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/security-best-practicespractices) to follow to ensure the security of the client and the network. Out of which the following holds the utmost importance:

#### Slashing Avoidance

Validators are hold accountable for their on-chain actions towards the safety and liveness of the protocol using possible slashing conditions. Guidelines to avoid slashing are outlined in the [documentation](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/security-best-practices#slash-avoidance).

#### Wallet and key management

Although there is a separation between the credentials used to stake and withdrawal, it is important to keep the keys secure. The [documentation](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/security-best-practices#slash-avoidance) outlines the best practices to keep the keys secure.

### Most Frequently Asked Questions

For more frequently asked question about the client, refer to the [FAQ](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/faq).

## Teku

[Teku](https://consensys.io/teku) is a client developed in the Java programming language. It is developed by [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/). It is a full-featured Ethereum 2.0 client that can be used as a beacon node or a validator client. It can work with execution client such as Besu. It can work on Ethereum mainnet and testnets such as Goerli, Sepolia, and Holesky. It has a web interface to monitor the beacon chain and validator performance. Teku provides both beacon client and validator client to also run as docker containers.

### Installing the client

The Teku client can be installed using 3 main ways - using docker, building from source, and using pre-built binaries.

#### Using Docker

Teku provides a more illustrative guide to install the client using docker. They have options of [Docker Hub](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/get-started/install/run-docker-image#run-teku-docker-image) and using [docker compose](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/get-started/install/run-docker-image#run-teku-using-docker-compose).

#### Building from Source

Building the client from source is also an option in Teku. the client is written in Java. The [documentation](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/get-started/install/build-from-source) provides the steps to build the client from source for different operating systems such as Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

#### Pre-built Binaries

Perhaps the easiest way to run a client in a production environment is to use pre-built binaries. The Java based binary is very stable and quite standard to run on different operating systems. The [documentation](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/get-started/install/install-binaries) provides the steps to install and run the client using pre-built binaries.

### Additional features and security considerations

Running a Teku client from a recent state is quite easy and has faster syncing times. Using a recent finalized checkpoint state, Teku can sync within the weak subjectivity period. Ethereum Beacon chain checkpoints list is available [here](https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/). For reference on how to run a Teku client using a recent finalized checkpoint state, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/get-started/checkpoint-start).

Teku also provides a slashing protection mechanism, especially in the case where one is migrating from another client to Teku. The [documentation](https://docs.teku.consensys.io/reference/cli/subcommands/slashing-protection#import) provides the steps to migrate from other clients to Teku.
