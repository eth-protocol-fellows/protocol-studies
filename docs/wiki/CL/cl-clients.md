# Consensus Client

> **Consensus clients**, formerly known as *eth2 clients*, run Ethereum's proof-of-stake consensus algorithm allowing the network to reach agreement about the head of the Beacon Chain. Consensus clients do not participate in validating/broadcasting transactions or executing state transitions: that is done by execution clients. Consensus clients do not attest to, or propose new blocks: that is done by the validator client which is an optional add-on to the consensus client.

## Overview Table

These clients are developed in different programming languages, provide have unique features and offer different performance profiles. All clients support Ethereum mainnet out of the box along with active testnets. Variety of implementations allows the network to benefit from client diversity. If you are choosing a client to use, current client diversity should be one of the main factors.

## Distribution

The overwhelming majority of node operators are currently using either Prysm or Lighthouse as a Consensus Client.
In the interest of supporting the health of the Beacon Chain (formerly ETH2), it is recommended to use different clients.
[Why?](https://clientdiversity.org/#why)


### Lighthouse
Lighthouse, written in Rust by Sigma Prime, emphasizes security and performance. It's widely adopted but caution is advised as a supermajority could potentially lead to chain splits.
Lighthouse is licensed under Apache 2.0 and known for its robustness in production environments. 

Lighthouse provides binaries for every platform including ARM and allows cross compilation. There are portable versions which are compromising compiler performance options for a better platform compatibility. Released binaries are signed by gpg key `15E66D941F697E28F49381F426416DC3F30674B0` from security@sigmaprime.io.

Noteworthy Features:

- [Slashing Protection](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_slashing_protection.html)
- [Doppelganger Protection](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/validator_doppelganger.html)
- [Running a Slasher](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/advanced_slasher.html)

### Lodestar
Lodestar is a TypeScript-based Ethereum consensus client by ChainSafe, tailored for rapid prototyping and browser compatibility.
It supports beacon node and validator client functionalities, offering essential libraries like BLS and SSZ for Ethereum protocol development.
Lodestar is double-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), allowing users to choose between a permissive and a copyleft licensing model.
