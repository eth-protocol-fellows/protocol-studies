# Networking

The Consensus clients use [libp2p][libp2p] as the peer-to-peer protocol, [libp2p-noise][libp2p-noise] for encryption, [discv5][discv5] for peer discovery, [SSZ][ssz] for encoding, and, optionally, [Snappy][snappy] for compression.

For those looking to deepen their understanding of libp2p, Study Group Session Week-5, [Lecture 19]("https://epf.wiki/#/eps/day19") by Dapplion is a great resource.

## Specs

The [Phase 0 -- Networking][consensus-networking] page specifies the network fundamentals, protocols, and rationale/design choices. The subsequent forks also specify the changes done in that respective fork.

## libp2p - P2P protocol

[libp2p][libp2p-docs] is used as the peer-to-peer protocol. [libp2p and Ethereum][libp2p-and-eth] is a great article for a deep-dive on the history of libp2p, and its adoption in the Consensus clients.

## libp2p-noise - Encryption

The [Noise framework][noise-framework] is not a protocol itself, but a framework for designing key exchange protocols. The [specification][noise-specification] is a great place to start.

There are many [patterns][noise-patterns] which describe the key exchange process. The pattern used in the consensus clients is [`XX`][noise-xx] (transmit-transmit), meaning that both the initiator, and responder transmit their public key in the initial stages of the key exchange.

## ENR (Ethereum Node Records)
[Ethereum Node Records][ENR] provide a structured, flexible way to store and share node identity and connectivity details in Ethereumâ€™s peer-to-peer network. It is a future-proof format that allows easier exchange of identifying information between new peers and is the preferred [network address format][network-add-format] for Ethereum nodes.

Its core components are:
1. **Signature**: Each record is signed using an identity scheme (e.g., secp256k1) to ensure authenticity.
2. **Sequence Number** (seq): A 64-bit unsigned integer that increments whenever the record is updated, allowing peers to determine the latest version.
3. **Key/Value Pairs**: The record holds various connectivity details as key-value pairs.

## discv5
Discovery Version 5 [(discv5)][discv5] (Protocol version v5.1) is used for peer discovery. It enables nodes to exchange and update ENRs dynamically, ensuring up-to-date peer discovery.

## SSZ - Encoding

[Simple serialize (SSZ)][ssz] replaces the [RLP][rlp] serialization used on the execution layer everywhere across the consensus layer except the peer discovery protocol. SSZ is designed to be deterministic and also to Merkleize efficiently. SSZ can be thought of as having two components: a serialization scheme and a Merkleization scheme that is designed to work efficiently with the serialized data structure.

## Snappy - Compression

[Snappy][snappy] is a compression scheme created by engineers at Google in 2011. Its main design considerations prioritize compression/decompression speed, while still having a reasonable compression ratio.
