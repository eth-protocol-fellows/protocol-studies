Ethereum network started as a proof-of-work blockchain with the intention of switching to proof-of-stake after its bootstrap. The research produced a consensus mechanism combining Casper and GHOST, released in [Gasper paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052).

Based on its design, a specification was written in python. [Pyspec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs) is an executable specification that serves as a reference for consensus layer developers. It is also used as reference for client implementations and for creating the test case vectors for clients.
