# **Welcome to the protocol!**

The EPF Wiki is a collection of technical resources about the Ethereum protocol. It's home to all resources from EPF Study Group and the Protocol Wiki. These include technical information covering all core protocol domains and ongoing research. It's dedicated to serve aspiring core contributors and does not cover any smart contract or other high level development. The content consists of 2 parts: Study Group materials and community maintained Protocol Wiki. 

## Protocol Study Group

Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Study Group (EPFsg) is an open study program for anyone interested in learning about internals of the protocol. The first part of EPF Wiki follows all the content presented during the study group. Materials provided by speakers and all their presentation are listed by weeks. 

**[Start your studies](/eps/intro.md) using the wiki here** and learn more about the study group in its original [announcement blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/07/epf-study-group). 

> The study group is not just a list of resources but a community of people maintaining them and learning about the core protocol. **Join the community in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/addwpQbhpq)**.


## Protocol Wiki 

Protocol Wiki is a technical documentation of the main parts of Ethereum core development and research. It guides anyone interested in looking under the hood of the protocol and contributing. The wiki is maintained by the community formed around the study group and keeps following the latest research. 

> :warning: Protocol Wiki is still under construction, many important topics are not fully covered. **If you find a missing content or issues, don't hesitate to [contribute](contributing.md)**.
